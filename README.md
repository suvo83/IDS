# 🛡️ Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

A lightweight Intrusion Detection System built using Python and C, designed to monitor network traffic and detect suspicious or malicious activities. This IDS project showcases a rule-based and anomaly detection approach with real-time alerting and logging capabilities.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Packet sniffing using `scapy` or raw sockets
- 🔍 Signature-based detection for known threats
- 📈 Anomaly detection based on network behavior
- 📄 Detailed logging of detected intrusions
- 🔔 Real-time alerts on terminal or file
- 🧠 Modular and extensible design for custom rules

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python** – Core detection logic and packet analysis
- **Scapy** – For packet sniffing
---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/suvo83/IDS.git
cd IDS
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3. Run the IDS
```bash
sudo python3 main.py
```
Note: Root privileges may be required for packet capturing.

## 🧪 Sample Attack Detection
- ✅ Port Scanning
- ✅ SYN Flood
- ✅ Ping of Death
- ✅ Malicious Payloads
- ✅ Unauthorized Access Attempts

## 📊 Screenshots

## 🎯 Future Improvements
- GUI Dashboard for real-time alerts
- Integration with a SIEM system
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Email or SMS alerting system
